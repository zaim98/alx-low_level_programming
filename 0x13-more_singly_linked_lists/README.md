In this C project, the focus is on singly linked lists. The project provides various functions to manipulate and work with linked lists. Here's a short summary of the tasks involved:
Print List:** The  function prints all the elements of a linked list and returns the number of nodes in the list.
List Length:** The  function returns the number of elements in a linked list.
Add Node:** The  function adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
Add Node at the End:** The  function adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
Free List:** The  function frees the memory occupied by a linked list.
Free List (Safe Version):** The  function frees a linked list and sets the head to , allowing it to handle lists with loops safely.
The  function deletes the head node of a linked list and returns its data.
Get Node at Index:** The  function locates a given node in the linked list based on its index.
Sum List:** The  function returns the sum of all data () in a linked list.
Insert Node at Index:** The  function inserts a new node at a specified index in the linked list.
Delete Node at Index:** The  function deletes a node at a given index in the linked list.
Reverse List:** The  function reverses the linked list using a maximum of one loop and two variables.
Print List (Safe Version):** The  function prints a linked list safely, even if it contains loops, and returns the number of nodes in the list.
Free List (Safe Version):** The  function frees a linked list safely, even if it contains loops. It returns the size of the freed list and sets the head to .
Find the Loop:** The  function finds and returns the address of the node where the loop starts in a linked list using a maximum of two variables. If no loop is found, it returns .
hese functions allow you to create, modify, and manipulate singly linked lists in C.
